# Home Connect Local

The **Home Connect Local** allows users to integrate their home appliances supporting the  [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/global) standard for Bosch and Siemens using direct communication over the local network.

## Use Cases
[comment]: <> (Stolen directly from the Core Home Connect integration)
- Monitor the multiple sensors of the appliance and trigger automations based on these sensors.
- Start programs on your appliances from your dashboard.
- Monitor the program status of the appliances.
- Control the light of your appliances.
- Adjust the appliance settings.

## Install the Integration

1. Go to the HACS -> Custom Repositories and add this repository as a Custom Repository [See HACS Documentation for help](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)

2. Click the button bellow and click 'Download' to install the Integration:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=homeconnect_local_hass&owner=chris-mc1)

3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Supported Devices

Any Home Connect device that 
1. Allows a local connection (not all do) (View trouble shooting for more info to make sure your device supports a local connection)
2. On the same local network as your Home Assistant instance

## Prerequisites

To use this integration, you must first create a Home Connect account and connect your appliances.

## Setup

1. Use the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader) to download your Appliance profiles, select "Home Assistant - Home Connect Local" as target. The downloaded ZIP-file contains each Appliance encryption Key and feature descriptions
2. Click the button below or use "Add Integration" in Home Assistant and select "Home Connect Local".

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=homeconnect_ws)

3. Upload the downloaded Profile file.
4. Select the Appliance you want to setup.
5. When the initial connection to the Appliance fails, your asked to manually enter your Appliance IP-Address.
6. Repeat from Step 2 if you want to setup more than one Appliances.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do <ins> **NOT**</ins> delete your Home Connect account after this. If you do then
> 
> - The device may disconnect itself from your Wi-Fi
> - You cannot troubleshoot if the appliance does not connect to Home Assistant
> - You cannot connect any more devices to it
>
> If you value your privacy you can instead go to the app settings an disable all the data collection stuff in the "Privacy and Legal" section of the app

### Configuration parameters

- Profile file: The Profile File you've downloaded with the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader)
- Select Appliance: Select the Appliance you want to setup
- Host / IP-Address: Manually enter your Appliance Hostname or IP-Address if auto discovery did not work

### Protip!

If you want to, once you have connected the appliance to Home Assistant you can disable its cloud access.

Through Home Assistant

1. (OPTIONAL) Before starting, in the Home Connect app, make sure the bottom line (direct connection between your phone and device) is green in case if something goes wrong.
2. In the configuration section there is a disabled entity called "Allow Cloud Connection" enable it and turn off the switch
3. (OPTIONAL) Enable the "Cloud Connection" diagnostic entity to verify its disconnected from the cloud.

If you see the "Cloud Connection" entity saying disconnected then you have succesfully disabled cloud access for your appliance.

Through Home Connect
1. Open the Home Connect app and go to your appliance's settings.
2. Scroll down until you get the "network" and tap the details button.
3. (OPTIONAL) Make sure the bottom line (direct connection between your phone and device) is green in case if something goes wrong.
4. Scroll down (again) until you see the connection to the server toggle.
5. Turn off the toggle and ignore the scare screen (they have it there so they can continue collecting your data)
6. Then save

You'll know if you have successfully done it if you see the line between your appliance and their cloud is grayed out and disconnected.

>[!NOTE]
>Do note that your device will **not** get firmware updates once disconnected, if you want to, you can occasionally (once every 1-3 months) reenable the cloud connection for 1-2 days so the device can check for an update.

Heres an example automation you can do with Home Assistant to occasionally reenable the cloud then do a firmware update (incase if theres one) then disable it.
```yaml
alias: Periodically check for and install Home Connect firmware updates
description: >-
  Re-enables the appliance's cloud connection on the 1st of every month so it
  has a chance to check in, then downloads (if supported) and installs any
  available firmware update via the Update entities before disabling cloud
  access again.

## Data Updates

This integration is soley pushed based with it receiving updates from the appliance the moment something happens to it. Post setup, this integration can work completely offline, unlike the Home Connect app.

## Supported Functions

The following entities are available. Which ones appear depends on the appliance type and its feature set. Not every device supports every entity listed here.

### All Appliances

| Entity | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active Program | Sensor | Currently running program |
| Operation State | Sensor | Device state (e.g. Ready, Running, Finished) |
| Remaining Program Time | Sensor | Time left in the current program |
| Program Progress | Sensor | Progress as a percentage |
| Start In | Sensor / Number | Delay before the program starts |
| Finish In | Sensor / Number | Target time until the program finishes |
| Select Program | Select | Choose a program to run |
| Start / Abort / Pause / Resume | Button | Control the active program |
| Power State | Switch / Select | Turn the appliance on or off |
| Child Lock | Switch | Lock the physical controls |
| Remote Start Allowed | Binary Sensor | Whether remote control is enabled on the device |
| Door State | Binary Sensor / Sensor | Whether the door is open or closed |
| Program Finished | Binary Sensor | Turns on when the current cycle completes |
| Wi-Fi Signal Strength | Sensor | Device's Wi-Fi signal strength |
| Cloud Connection | Binary Sensor | Whether the appliance is currently connected to the Home Connect cloud |
| Allow Cloud Connection | Switch | Enable or disable the appliance's connection to the Home Connect cloud |
| Allow Consumer Insights | Switch | Enable or disable usage data collection by the Home Connect cloud |
| Synchronize Time with Server | Switch | Whether the appliance keeps its clock in sync with a time server |
| Time Format | Select | 12-hour or 24-hour clock display |
| Software Update | Update | Tracks/triggers installing an available firmware update |
| Software Download | Update | Tracks/triggers downloading an available firmware update (only on appliances that support a separate download stage) |

A few additional diagnostic entities (Local Control Active, Remote Control Active) are also available, disabled by default.

The Home Connect protocol only signals that a firmware update exists, not which version it is, so the Update entities show a generic "New Version" placeholder rather than a real version number when one is available. Also, as mentioned before, if you [disabled cloud access](#protip) for your appliance, or it cannot reach the Home Connect Cloud, then it cannot get new firmware updates.

Some entites are excluded from this integration on purpose, even though the Home Connect Protocol Supports it
| Entity/featureDescription | UID (hex) | Reason for exclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
|BSH.Common.Command.ApplyFactoryReset|0229|Irreversible change|
|BSH.Common.Command.ApplyNetworkReset|022A|Also an irreversible change|
|BSH.Common.Command.DeactivateWiFi|0001|Reversible, but will prevent HA from accessing the appliance until physically activated again|

```


### Start a program when electricity is cheap
[comment]: <> ( Also also stolen directly from the Core Home Connect integration)
Because electricity is typically cheaper at night, this automation will activate the silent mode when starting the program at night.

```yaml
alias: "Start program when electricity is cheap"
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: sensor.electricity_price
    to: "0.10"
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.diswasher_door
    state: closed
actions:
  - if:
      - condition: time
        after: '22:00:00'
        before: '06:00:00'
    then:
      - action: home_connect.set_program_and_options
        data:
          device_id: "your_device_id"
          affects_to: "active_program"
          program: "dishcare_dishwasher_program_eco_50"
          dishcare_dishwasher_option_silence_on_demand: true
    else:
      - action: home_connect.set_program_and_options
        data:
          device_id: "your_device_id"
          affects_to: "active_program"
          program: "dishcare_dishwasher_program_eco_50"
```

## Known Limitations

- While this integration can (in theory) support all the functions supported in the Home Connect app, in reality, the functions have to reverse engineered
- The mDNS on Home Connect devices is wonky and fail to connect. The best example of this is that in the App, unless if the phone is on the same Wireless Access Point as the appliance theres a chance a local connection may fail to establish.
- Home Assistant may overload the device's local capacity causing it to not accept new connections for 24 hours. This is called a **Websocket Shutdown**. See [this section](#how-to-resolve-a-websocket-shutdown) for more info and how to resolve it.
- The Appliance must be online and reachable on your local network during initial setup. The config flow actively tests the connection before letting you finish adding the device, so it cannot be added while powered off or unreachable. Once added, the appliance can go offline/online freely and its entities will simply go unavailable and recover automatically. See issues https://github.com/chris-mc1/homeconnect_local_hass/issues/274 and https://github.com/chris-mc1/homeconnect_local_hass/issues/293 for info about why it is like this.

## Requesting a New Feature

Since this integration's functions have to be reverse engineered (see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)), the more information you provide when requesting a new entity, the easier it is for a developer to add it. There are two ways to do this, depending on how much effort you want to put in.

### Basic method

1. Use the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader) to download your appliance profile, selecting "Home Assistant - Home Connect Local" as the target.
2. Unzip the downloaded file. You'll get three files: a `*_DeviceDescription.xml`, a `*_FeatureMapping.xml`, and a `.json` file.
   - **Do not share the `.json` file.** It contains sensitive info like your appliance's local encryption key.
3. Rename the `*_DeviceDescription.xml` and `*_FeatureMapping.xml` files to remove the MAC address segment from the filename (e.g. `THERMADOR-PRG486WDH-##MACADDRESS##_DeviceDescription.xml` → `THERMADOR-PRG486WDH_DeviceDescription.xml`). That segment only identifies your specific physical appliance and isn't needed by developers.
4. Download the [Diagnostics](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#download-diagnostics) of the appliance's Config Entry.
5. [Open a feature request](https://github.com/chris-mc1/homeconnect_local_hass/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) describing, in plain terms, the feature/entity you'd like added (e.g. "I want a sensor for my appliance's door state"), and attach the two renamed XML files along with the Diagnostics.

### Advanced method

If you're comfortable digging a bit deeper, you can help pinpoint exactly which feature maps to the entity you want, which makes it much faster for a developer to add:

1. Follow steps 1-4 of the Basic method above.
2. [Enable debug logging](#enabling-debug-logging) for the integration.
3. Trigger the feature on the appliance itself (e.g. open the door, change a setting, start a program) and watch the debug log for the corresponding update message.
4. Note the UID logged for that update. It will be in **decimal**, while the UIDs inside the `*_DeviceDescription.xml`/`*_FeatureMapping.xml` files are in **hexadecimal** — convert between the two to match them up. For example, on a Thermador oven, the live oven temperature in fahrenheit logs as UID `5959` (decimal), which is `1747` in hex, matching `Cooking.Oven.Status.Cavity.340.CurrentTemperatureFahrenheit` in the FeatureMapping file.
5. Include that UID/feature name (and what it corresponds to) in your issue, alongside everything from the Basic method, so developers know exactly which feature to wire up.

## Trouble Shooting

### Home Assistant cannot connect to my Appliance, what should I do?
If Home Assistant cannot connect to your appliance (during setup) despite correctly entering the right profile file and IP address, here are some tips:
- Try to see if Home Connect can establish a local connection on the same network as Home Assistant.
- To do this, open the Home Connect App, go to your appliance(s), then to its settings, then scroll down to the network section.
  - If you see the bottom line lit up green, this could mean two things:
    1. You have the wrong/outdated profile file. Make sure you have the correct file, and if it's outdated, get a new one.
    2. As noted in the known limitations, the mDNS on the device is wonky, and if mDNS fails, even a direct IP connection may fail.
  - If you don't see the bottom line lit up green, this could mean a few things:
    1. If you're on the same wireless access point as the device, your device is most likely offline or does not support a local connection.
    2. If you're not on the same wireless access point, make sure you are.
    3. The device may be offline; check it physically to see if there's no Wi-Fi signal indicator on it.
    4. If the device does have a Wi-Fi signal, then Home Assistant may have overloaded the device's local capacity, causing a websocket shutdown. See below on how to resolve it.

### How to resolve a websocket shutdown

This integration has built in measures (measures not fully tested yet) to prevent a websocket shutdown, however unexpectedly shutting down Home Assistant bypasses these measures. If enough unexpected shutdowns of Home Assistant happen, then Home Assistant will leave half-dead sessions that overload the device's session capacity, leading to a websocket shutdown.

There are three ways to resolve a websocket shutdown:
1. Disable the cloud: Disabling the cloud (follow the [protip](#protip) section on how to do it), then waiting 24 hours, can allow the device to reopen its local websocket. Note that since you're doing this during a local websocket shutdown, the smart features of the device will be inoperable until the device reopens its websocket. The device will still stay connected to your Wi-Fi.
2. Power cycle the appliance: Cutting the power from your appliance for 1-5 minutes, then reapplying it, can help resolve the issue.
3. Re-pair the appliance (not recommended): Resetting the device's network settings and re-pairing it to the Home Connect App resolves the issue. However, doing that is not only time consuming, but you also have to get a new profile file, remove the entry, and re-add it with the new file.

### Reporting Issues and Bugs

- A full debug log of at least reloading the config entry and any actions leading to an error
- The [Diagnostics](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#download-diagnostics) of the Config Entry
- For reports relating to adding a new Appliance: the `*_DeviceDescription.xml` and `*_FeatureMapping.xml` files from the Profile File

### Enabling debug logging

Use one of these two methods enable debug logging:

- Through the UI:
    1. [Enable Debug logging](<https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting>) on the detail page of the integration
    2. Reload the config entry
    3. Perform the actions that lead to an error
    4. [Disable Debug logging](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#disable-debug-logging-and-download-logs) on the detail page of the integration

- OR -

- Through configuration.yaml:
    1. Add the following to your [configuration.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) file:

        ```yaml
        logger:
        logs:
            custom_components.homeconnect_ws: debug # Home Connect Local Integration
            homeconnect_ws: debug
            homeconnect_websocket: debug # Homeconnect websocket Python package
        ```

    2. Restart Home Assistant
    3. Perform the actions that lead to an error
    4. Click the button below or navigate to "Settings" -> "Logs".

        [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your Home Assistant logs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/logs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/logs/?)
